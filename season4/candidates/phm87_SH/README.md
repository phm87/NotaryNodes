I'm candidate to be Notary Node during the next season in order to continue to contribute to iguana (stopcoin, pausecoin, few fixes), enhance notary scripts, contribute to AtomicDEX/mm2 (integration into yiimp ongoing, Lightning Network submarine swaps integration) and maybe launch and support other projects (auto-exchange pool, run komodo on ARM hardware).

I tested many things on my phm87_SH node during the 2019-2020 season: my notarization performances were sometimes in the top 3 and sometimes very low. Whatever many notary nodes were impressed by these performances, my node was not re-elected.

During 2019-2020 season, I gave 20% of my KMD mined to Chips and 20% to KMDLabs. I will give some of my KMD earnings to some projects.

Thank you,


phm87
